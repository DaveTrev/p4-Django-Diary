## Introduction


Introduction

Eye|Contribute Cpd Diary is a simple online diary to log continued education for Dispensing Opticians and Optometrists in Ireland. Under the regulatory body CORU, each member must keep a diary of all learning carried out in a year.

On registration with Eye|Contribute, it allows each user to create a personal journal of their learning activities and track their cpd credits in a easy to follow centralised manner.
Each diary entry, covers the information required by CORU, such as time spent and activities undertaken.

Users can set up an account that allows them to add, edit and delete entries. 
The project was designed as the 4th portfolio project of the Code Institutes Full Stack Diploma Program. It was built using

-   Django
    
-   Python
    
-   Js
    
-   CSS
    
-   HTML
    
-   Postgresql

### Project Goals

The goal of the project was to fulfil a need (and want) in my life as a Dispensing Optician, to build an easy to use online diary for logging continued learning for optical professionals.
Each diary entry must have the correct layout as required by the regulations set out by CORU.
The site allows users to register and create private diary entries, the purpose, to collate and log all learning undertaken in a simple to use digital diary.
Each diary enter is private to that specific user, only they can create, edit or delete entries.
My main objective was to make this  as mobile friendly as possible, enabling users to log conversations, topics they have encountered on their day in practice easily. 

### Data Base Design

The Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) shows the database's structure, which is essential to this site's functionality:

![ERD](static/Media/erd(no_background).png)

A User Model is provided by Django, Allauth is used to handle registration and user authentication. The custom model "Entry" is used to log entries to the CPD diary.

The fields required by the Entry model is as follows.

-   Date (Automatically generated from the day of entry)
    
-   Title
    
-   Learning outcome
    
-   Activity type
    
-   Cpd credits
    
-   Time spent
    
-   Impact on practice.

A `User` Model is provided by Django, and the `Entry Model` stores the details of users CPD diary entries. The user can add many additions to their diary, in order to store notes to refer back to should they need it. 

The `Entry` model is based on the personal diary walkthrough project by Real Python. However, the models were significantly altered to fit the needs of this project. The `Entry` model has added fields of 'Learning Outcome', 'Activity Type, 'Time Spent', 'Cpd Credits' and 'Practice Impact'. 

**Future Models**

In the future, the developer would like to add additional models, a custom user profile, allowing users to tailor their personal details on the site.

As part of the entry model, the developer would like to add an additional feature of uploading supporting documents to the diary database, to provide evidence and reference for the user.

### Wireframe

### Surface

#### Colour Scheme

The site is designed to light on images, I wanted to keep a very clean / professional approach to the site design, to try and ensure quick page loads and unobtrusive site navigation.

In general, the colour palette is kept in relatively neutral so it lets the features of the site stand out and not distract the user

![Color Scheme](static/Media/colour_palette.png)

#### Font

For lengthy texts like those found in books, magazines, and webpages, Times New Roman is a great choice because of its high readability.
Times New Roman is a serif typeface. Serif fonts are frequently connected to tradition, authority, formality, and comfort.
Times New Roman's narrow shape makes it possible to fit more text per page, which is primarily why businesses choose it.
Times New Roman's use in academic papers and official documents, as well as its relationship with tradition and authority, can assist a website project a sense of competence and professionalism.

## Existing Features

### Header and Navigation

Navbar with logo, page name, links and search bar (for use with diary). Different links are visible for unauthenticated users and authenticated. Active links are rendered in black as opposed to the default grey. On small to medium screens the navigation links are displayed as a collapsible burger menu.

## Deployment & Development

### Deploy on Heroku

**Requirement and Procfile**

Before deployment on Heroku, two files need to be created and be up to date, a `requirements.txt` file and a `Procfile`.

- The `requirements.txt` file is created by executing the following command in the terminal window: ` pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`. A file with all requirements will be created.
- Then create a file named `Procfile` and insert the following code: `web: gunicorn worldtravels.wsgi`, with no empty lines after it.
- Then make sure to push these files to your repository.

**Creating Heroku App**

- Log into Heroku and go to the Dashboard.
- Click "New" and then select "Create new app".
- Give your app a name and select the region closest to you.
- Click "Create app" to confirm.

**Creating a database**

- Log into ElephantSQL.com and access your dashboard.
- Click "Create New Instance"
- Set up a plan, give your plan a **Name**, select the **Tiny Turtel (Free)** plan, leave the **Tags** field blank.
- Select "Select Region" and select a data center new you.
- Click "Review".
- Confirm your details and then click "Create instance".
- Return to the ElephantSQL dashboard and click on the database instance name for this project.
- In the URL section, click the copy icon to copy the database URL.
- In your workspace make sure django and gunicorn are installed by running `pip3 install 'django<4' gunicorn`.
- Equally make sure that infrastructure for the database is installed by running `pip3 install dj_database_url===0.5.0 psycopg2`.
- Update the `requirements.txt` file if needed.

**The env.py file**

- If you do not have a `env.py` file in your workspace create one and make sure it is included in the `.gitignore` file.
- At the top of the `env.py` file add the line: `import os`.
- Below that add the following two lines:

  `os.environ["DATABASE_URL"] = "<copied URL from SQL database>"` <br>
  `os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "<create a secret key of your own>"` <br>

- If you are using Cloudinary storage also add the following line: <br>

  `os.environ["CLOUDINARY_URL"] = "<copied URL from Cloudinary account>"`<br>

- Make sure the environment variables are imported correctly into the `settings.py` file.
- Run `python manage.py migrate` in the terminal window to migrate the data structure to the database instance.

**Setting Environment Variables**

- On the Heroku Dashboard select the app you just created and then select the "Settings" tab.
- Click "Reveal Config Vars"
- Add the following config vars: <br>

  `DATABASE_URL` - copy the database URL from ElephantSQL in here, it should also be in the `env.py` file. <br>
  `SECRET_KEY` - copy your secret key in here. <br>

- If you are using Cloudinary storage you also need to copy your personal `CLOUDINARY_URL` into these fields. <br>
- In addition, you may need the key `PORT` with value `8000`.

**Connecting to GitHub and Deploy**

- On the Heroku Dashboard select the app you just created and then select the "Deploy" tab.
- Select GitHub for the deployment method.
- Search for the name of the project repository and click "Connect".
- Further down the page, select "Enable Automatic Deploys" if desired.
- Then finally further down, select "Deploy Branch" and watch the app being built.

### Forking the Repository

- Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub repository you want to fork.
- At the top of the Repository above the "Settings" Tab on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button and click it.
- You will have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.
- You will now be able to make changes to the new version and keep the original safe.

### Making a Local Clone

- Log into GitHub and locate the repository you want to clone.
- Click the 'Code' dropdown above the file list.
- Copy the URL for the repository.
- Open Git Bash in your IDE.
- Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory.
- Type `git clone` in the CLI and then paste the URL you copied earlier. This is what it should look like:
  `$ git clone https://github.com/`
- Press Enter to create your local clone.

You will need to install all of the packages listed in the requirements file you can use the following command in the terminal `pip install -r requirements.txt` which will do it for you.

       See traceback above for details.
       You may need to update application code to resolve this error.
       Or, you can disable collectstatic for this application:
          $ heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1
       https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/django-assets
 !     Push rejected, failed to compile Python app.
 !     Push failed

deploying to heroku
corrected some mispellings, added DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC to config vars on heroku (this may cause issues with static files but that will be addressed when needed)

login = 'login' caused rooting issues
previously created custom login and logout pages, decided to install allauth, 
had to remove, customview, urls and settings code

{% extends base.html %} not working 
created a root templates folder and moved allauth's account folder into it and it appears now our allauth login.html template is connected
When we use the allauth roots in our project, if allauth can't find the templates within our workspace, it substitutes in ones without any styling


installed allauth, downloaded templates

Feedback
I put in my name as username then set up my passwords.
When I tried to move on, my user name was rejected as I had a space in it and my passwords were deleted. I would have liked to have known in advance that I could not have spaces in my user name.
When entering a new event, the box beside time has e.g. in it. You cannot see anymore detail.
Small details from a grouchy customer...basically, very impressive!
